IntroductionToAlgorithms
========================

This is a project about the implements and solution of data struct, algorithms and practical issues. 
The project is programmed in C++ and build in Visual Studio 2008(Windows) and Linux. 
I am very happy to share with you about the related things, I hope you can contribute your IDEAS about them. 
Thanks a lot!

If you want to use and build the project, you should make sure the following things to be done:
1. For Windows, You need install VS2008 or later version.
2. For Linux, You need to install g++.

If you want to contribute new implements or solution of data struct, algorithms and practical issues,
you should:
1. Abstract the implementation as the form of C++ class inherited from class AbstractBase.
2. You should implement the two methods: Description() and Test().
3. It would be great if you comment the code you have written.

Thanks again! Wish you join with me~
